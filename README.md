## Introduction
This class challenge was to design an interactive ordering system for a foodtruck using Python. This exercise incorporated the following areas of knowledge:
* Creating a repository in GitHub
* Designing a foodtruck ordering system using:
    * Dictionaries
    * Loops
    * Inputs
    * Adding new lists to a dictionary
    * if-else statements
    * Creating variables
    * Match case structure
    * Reviewing and navigating comples nested data structures
    * Printing out the results
* Submitting this challenge for review

## Results
This class challenge was well designed to get me to think about how to break out the task at hand and how to properly execute it. The pseudocode that was in the starter files helped guide me along the process, and showed me the areas in which I need to continue to dig in and develop my knowledge.

## References
In this challenge, I utilized some reference material to assist in completing this homework:
* In class exercises - I accessed the unsolved and solved exercises for Week 2, Class 2: Create_a_Menu and Week 2, Class 3:  Printing_a_Menu
* I utilized Tutoring through Bootcamp and was assisted by Mohammed Fauwaaz to debug my work and understand the match case structure to properly execute this code exercise
